# JFET_METER
## Why I made this
Jfet is treaky. But that treaky make JFET irreplaceable, especially in audio. So, how I deal with it? Usually, measuring and screening for Idss. It varies even in  JFETs with same production line. In fact, there is more important factor than Idss. It is Vgm, closer to the characteristic of JFET. Because, JFET is voltage-controlled devices, and Vgm is simply 'device's sensivity of controling voltage'. However, Idss is more commmonly characteristic. Even though it is just meaning JFET's maxium current. But, there are reasons. 

1. Idss is much eaiser to measure, because it is just 'max current when JFET is fully on state'. Let's assume that you have to measure Vgm. Essentially Vgm is graph slope of between current and control voltage. And you have to measure several points to figure out slope. On the other hand, Idss is just one point.
